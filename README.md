# pre-ejection-period-estimation-algorithms
Algorithms to estimate pre-ejection-period (related to cardiac contractility) from a wearable accelerometer and gyroscope placed on the chest. Different regression algorithms (xgboost, random forest, extra trees, ridge and lasso regression) can be compared along with different sensor-axis combinations. Hyper-parameter sweeps also implemented.
